# Instagram Reel Downloader

The **Reel Downloader** project is a simple yet effective Python-based application that allows users to download Instagram Reels directly using the [Instaloader](https://github.com/instaloader/instaloader) library. The system focuses on providing a lightweight, user-friendly way to fetch reels while removing unnecessary metadata and files, ensuring only the video is retained.

## Overview
Instagram Reels have become a popular way of sharing short videos. However, downloading them for offline viewing isnâ€™t supported natively. This project solves that problem by allowing users to input a reel URL and download the video directly to their system.  

The project leverages **Instaloader** for downloading and includes built-in cleanup functions to remove unwanted files, leaving only the `.mp4` video.  

Additionally, the repository includes **unit tests (pytest)** to ensure reliability and maintainability.
